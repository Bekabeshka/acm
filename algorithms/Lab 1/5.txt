5. Bridge is an edge removing which we disconnect the graphs. 
As tree do not have cycles, removing one edge will disconnect the tree, therefore we will obtain one more tree. 
So we can assume than every edge in a tree can be called bridge. Due to this fact, there will be n – 1 bridges in the tree.
